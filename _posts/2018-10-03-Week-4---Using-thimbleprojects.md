    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I raised my hand at some points, but not too often, so I should have asked Mr Keen more questions as that could enhance my learning.</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Overall I think this I.T lesson went well compared to others but I think I should have explored the uses of thimbleprojects more.</td>

    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>Like I mentioned, I raised my hand at some points in the lesson, however I didn’t ask as many questions as I think I should’ve.</td>

    <td>This lesson started by us getting into class, logging on and being told to come to the front of the classroom. Mr Keen pulled up a website on his computer called "thimbleprojects" which is a website like github, in which you can input code into a css file and basically make a webpage. However what separates it from github is that you can’t publish your website and it’s instantaneous. So when you make an edit in your code, the change shows up automatically, so it’s a good website if you want to check what would work and what wouldn’t if you came to make an actual website. I think it could have gone better though if I actually input those changes I made on thimbleprojects into my actual github blog. However, this is what I am about to do as part of my homework. I’m going to make my blog look a lot more appealing.</td>

    <td>Next lesson I’ll make sure that I can work more swiftly so, for example, I could get onto changing my github blog quicker, rather than testing things out on thimbleprojects for the entire lesson, although I think it was still a lesson well spent.</td>
