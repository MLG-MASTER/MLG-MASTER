    <td>This lesson we were told to open up Google Classroom and complete the tasks stated on there. We were supposed to write a kind of command to, basically, find out the price of seats at a theatre production. I completed the majority of the task by reading google classroom and thinking for myself. However there came a point, to do with conditional formatting, in which I asked my partner, Amar, as I wasn’t sure on what to do. Amar pointed me in the right direction and I was eventually able to complete the task set.</td>
