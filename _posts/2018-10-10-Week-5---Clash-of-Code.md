    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I think that this was quite a laid back, fun I.T lesson so it was easy to persevere.</td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I didn't have to question the teacher too much as he didn’t know. We had a supply teacher, I only questioned my peers.</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked independently for the entire lesson because I didn’t need a lot of help, as the website we used was informative enough.</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Overall I think this I.T lesson went well as it wasn’t too challenging.</td>

    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged in the lesson as much as I could, simply by using the Clash of Code website.</td>

    <td>This lesson started by us getting into class, and being met with a supply teacher. As the supply teacher didn’t know much about coding, or css, or what we’re doing in Computer Science in general, we were told to log onto a website called 'www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode’. This is a website that you can practice your coding skills on with your friends. You join a clash of code lobby and are then set with challenges to complete. The person who completes the task most successfully in the least time wins. This is what I could gather from the website. I mainly played against Dylan, Amar, Ty, Ayan and some others. I could have improved however, on my knowledge of coding in general. There were quite a few points in the lesson where I just didn’t know what to do.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>A way I could improve my learning would be, just to simply use websites like github, thimbleprojects, clash of code. Etc a lot more. This would help improve my knowledge which would later help me.</td>
