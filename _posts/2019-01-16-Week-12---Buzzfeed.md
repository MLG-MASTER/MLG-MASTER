    <td>This lesson Mr Keen told us to log onto buzzfeed and take one or two of the ridiculous, useless quizzes that they have on there. He then told us that we’d be making our own buzzfeed quiz on repl.it using Python. He told us to come up with a main question, many small questions and a way the quiz could come up with an answer. We worked in groups and, when asked by mr Keen, i put my hand up and contributed and engaged well with the lesson. Other than that I think i could have worked quicker.</td>
