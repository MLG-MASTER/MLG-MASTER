    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I think I could have persevered a bit better in this I.T lesson as I wasn't sure what to do at some points and I got somewhat confused. I listened to Mr Keen as well as I could, but I did end up getting stuck as some points.</td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I raised my hand sometimes, but not much, so I should have asked Mr Keen more questions as I wasn’t too sure at some points</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked independently for most of the lesson however at one point I got confused and had to ask my partner for help.</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Overall I think this I.T lesson was ok but I think I should have put in more of an effort to listen more closely.</td>

    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>Like I mentioned, I raised my hand at some points in the lesson, however I didn’t ask as many questions as I think I should’ve.</td>

    <td>This lesson Mr Keen started by telling us all the uses of spreadsheets and how we are very likely to use them as adults when at our jobs. He then opened up Google Sheets on the board and taught us the basics about cypher codes. We were then told to go to our computers and try it out for ourselves. I feel like I should have listened a bit more closely to Mr Keen, as when I got to my computer I felt like I was confused, and I wasn’t quite sure where to start.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson I’ll make sure that I listen very closely to Mr Keen whenever he explains something, so that when I’m told to put it into action myself, I can do so with the all the good, right knowledge on how to do it.</td>
