    <td>This lesson we were told to edit our blogs and make them look better. I wasn’t sure whether we were meant to do this on thimbleprojects or github, so instead I continued with my work on github as I thought it would be a lot better for me, rather than completely starting over on thimbleprojects. I added a container which didn’t clash with any fonts or my background, I chose a better font style/font colour, which, once again, didn’t clash with anything. I then changed the opacity of my container to 30% rather than 100%, which I didn’t know you could do before. 

The only problem I had this lesson was that I wasn’t sure whether I was meant to make a new blog on thimble, or whether I should just carry on with my github blog, which I did. This did waste quite a lot of time, which hindered my learning, which in turn lead to me not getting as much done as i would have this lesson. </td>
