    <td>This lesson Mr Keen told us to come up with a spreadsheet to work out the price of a disco ticket with 20% profit. We started off by considering costs like drinks, food, entertainment, monitors, and other things like the length of the disco.etc. I then came up with a price for each of these, for example, a DJ would cost £25 per hour. We then had to put all of this into a table, add up all of the money and divide it by the amount of potential people attending the disco (I chose 300). We then had to times that number by 1.2 and I was then left with a disco ticket price where I would make roughly, a 20% profit overall. There was one point in the lesson, however, where I didn’t know how we were meant to set out our tables, so I asked my partner.

Here is my spreadsheet:

As for my blog, this week I plan on adding a solid border to my container on my github website, to make the website look more bold and to make it stand out and look more appealing.</td>
