    <td>This lesson we got into class and Mr Keen told us to have our github blogs on display for him to come and look at to check that we'd done it. Like many others, I had written the blog but didn’t have it submitted to my github website. He told us we had to resolve this for homework. I checked in my settings whether anything was wrong, and there was an error which I tried to resolve, and I thought I had corrected the error however my blog still didn’t show up on my website. I went on w3 schools, did what it said on there, but there still appears to be an error, so I plan on visiting coding club on Monday. In the lesson Mr Keen started by showing us some jumbled letters on the board: 'gdkkn’ which when decoded spells ‘hello’. Mr Keen then explained about how Caesar used to use codes like this a lot. We then spoke about how computers can only count up to a certain number (which I can’t remember) but when you type it into a digital calculator it comes up with ‘error’.</td>
