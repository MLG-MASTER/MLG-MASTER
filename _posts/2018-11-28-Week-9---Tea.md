    <td>This lesson Mr Keen told us to get into groups of 3 or 4 and write down a method on how to make tea. We then came back to the middle and shared with the rest of the class. Us writing about a method on tea making was harder than it sounds. We had to consider every factor, writing down exactly what to do and when to do it. This taught us about the idea of perseverance, in a way. </td>
