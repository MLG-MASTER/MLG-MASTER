    <td>This lesson we got into class and Mr Keen told us to come to the front so we could listen and interact with the lesson easier. We did so and we were told about what we'd be doing as a class in Computer Science this year. We were told that for the first 2 terms we’d be doing I.T and for the last one we’d be doing Drama. For the first term, we will be learning about encryption and data in I.T. However, firstly, before we start that, we were told to restart our github web page. We deleted our former repository and had to start from scratch. I began by naming my website to it’s name instead of "jekyll-now", forked the repository and got to work. I started by writing names and descriptions for my website, however I had some trouble with getting a background up and running.</td>

    <td>If I ever run into a problem when using github, I should go onto w3 schools and see how I can solve the problem myself. So it would be helpful if I could look on w3 schools to find a solution to my problem.</td>
